libSUFR INSTALL


You will need CMake to configure and compile the code.  CMake is open-source
software, and can be downloaded from http://www.cmake.org/.


To compile and install the code (in the default directories; /usr/local/), 
from the main package directory (the one that contains the file CMakeLists.txt), do:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake ..
 $ make install


To install the code in a specific directory, do:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/me/usr ..
 $ make install


To compile the code with your favourite compiler, prepend the cmake line with e.g. FC=gfortran:

 $ FC=gfortran cmake ..


To compile the code without installing it anywhere, replace the last step
 $ make install
with
 $ make


By default, files will be installed as:
/usr/local/lib/libSUFR_<NameOfFortranCompiler>.*  and
/usr/local/include/libSUFR/<NameOfFortranCompiler>/*.mod

The reason why the name of the Fortran compiler is included is that the modules
in Fortran are (still) compiler dependent (sigh...)
