libSUFR INSTALL


You will need CMake to configure and compile the code.  CMake is open-source
software, is included in many GNU/Linux distributions, and can be downloaded 
from http://www.cmake.org/.


To compile and install the code (in the default directories; /usr/local/...), 
from the main package directory (the one that contains the file CMakeLists.txt), do:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake ..
 $ make install


To install the code in a specific directory, do e.g.:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/me/usr ..
 $ make install


To compile the code with your favourite compiler, prepend the cmake line with e.g. 
FC=gfortran:

 $ FC=gfortran cmake ..


To compile the code without installing it anywhere, replace the last step
 $ make install
with
 $ make


By default, files will be installed as:
/usr/local/lib/libSUFR.*  and
/usr/local/include/libSUFR/*.mod


If you want to use the libraries with multiple Fortran compilers, you will want to 
keep the different versions of the library separated.  In this case, use (in addition 
to any other options):
 $ cmake -DCOMPILER_SPECIFIC_LIBS=on ..

The files will then be installed as:
/usr/local/lib/libSUFR_<NameOfFortranCompiler>.*  and
/usr/local/include/libSUFR/<NameOfFortranCompiler>/*.mod
If one of your Fortran compilers is your default, you can use both the default
installation method and the compiler-specific method to install the library.
