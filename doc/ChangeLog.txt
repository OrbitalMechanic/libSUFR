   32: 22/03/2011:  *** SF release 0.1.4 ***
     - Critical bugfix: 
       dow() was still called within libSUFR - hence the library couldn't link to
       programs other than TheSky (which has its own dow()).
     - Updated doc/make
     
   31: 12/03/2011:  *** SF release 0.1.3 ***
     - Make gfortran compiler flags compatible with v.4.4
     - Adapted comments
   
   30: 12/03/2011:
     - Added text.f90, with lowercase(), uppercase(), uppercaseinitial() from TheSky
       - use with TheSky v.213
     - Small fixes in kinds.f90 and date_and_time.f90
     
   28/29: 06/02/2011:
     - Moved code from TheSky, use with rev. 209 of TheSky:
       - added angles.f90: rev*, rv*, asep, calpa, pastr_*, wdstr_*
       - added system.f90: quit_program
       - date_and_time.f90: added jd2cal, dtm2jd, tm2hm, tm2hms, doy, ymd2doy, doy2md, leapyr
     - It seems that a function in a module cannot be called by other functions in the same
       module - in order to do so, and make all public, create a submodule that is called 
       by the main module *and* the function(!)
     - Updated Doxyfile, shortened Doxygen file descriptions
