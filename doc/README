libSUFR README


libSUFR is a LIBrary of Some Useful Fortran Routines that I wrote for my own use, 
but that may also be useful for others.  It currently also "SUFRs" from the fact 
that Fortran module files are compiler dependent...  To download the libSUFR 
package, read the code documentation, or to contact the developers, see: 
http://libsufr.sourceforge.net/
