libSUFR README


libSUFR is a LIBrary of Some Useful Fortran Routines that I wrote for my own use, 
but that may also be useful for others.  It currently also "SUFRs" from the fact 
that Fortran module files are compiler dependent...  To download the libSUFR 
package, read the code documentation, or to contact the developers, see: 
http://libsufr.sourceforge.net/

To compile and install the code (in the default directories; /usr/local/), 
from the main package directory (the one that contains the file CMakeLists.txt), do:
 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake ..
 $ make install


To install the code in a specific directory, do:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/me/usr ..
 $ make install


To compile the code with your favourite compiler, prepend the cmake line with e.g. FC=gfortran:
 $ FC=gfortran cmake ..


To compile the code without installing it anywhere, replace the last step
 $ make install
with
 $ make


By default, files will be installed as:
/usr/local/lib//libSUFR_<NameOfFortranCompiler>.*  and
/usr/local/include/libSUFR/<NameOfFortranCompiler>/*.mod

The reason why the name of the Fortran compiler is included is that the modules
in Fortran are (still) compiler dependent (sigh...)
