  CHANGELOG for libSUFR releases
  http://libsufr.sourceforge.net/
  
  
  0.2.0  17/10/2011  (bzr rev.56)
    * Updated CMake files:
      - compiler-specific library is now optional - by default the library and module
        files are installed in the default location.  If you want to use multiple
	Fortran compilers, use the option -DCOMPILER_SPECIFIC_LIBS=on for cmake.
	See doc/INSTALL.
      
  0.1.9  10/10/2011  (bzr rev.54)
    * Added routines:
      - replace_substring() in text.f90
    * Added constants:
      - one,c3rd,rc3rd, stdErr,StdIn,StdOut, hostname,username
    * Cetera:
      - simplified definitions of intkindmax, realkindmax. They are now parameters,
        as required in declarations. However, for compilers like g95, where quad
	precision is only partly implemented, this causes problems, since the very
	highest precision kind is used
      - minor updates to CMake files
      - declared func as external in root_solver() and minimum_solver()
  
  0.1.8  15/08/2011  (bzr rev.51)
    * Added source files:
      - command_line.f90: Procedures to handle command-line options and arguments
    * Added routines:
      - get_command_argument_i(), get_command_argument_l(), get_command_argument_r(), 
        get_command_argument_d(): read a command-line variable with type int, long, 
	real, double in command_line.f90
      - faculty_i(), faculty(), binom_coeff() and binom_prob() in statistics.f90
      - routines for linear interpolation in interpolate.f90
    * Cetera:
      - use 'only' attributes with 'use' statements in modules almost everywhere, to
        ensure that only the intended variables and functions become available.
      - updated compile flags
    
  0.1.7  25/04/2011  (SVN rev.44)
    * Added source files:
      - earth.f90 with routines for geography
    * Added routines:
      - distance() and distance_r() in earth.f90
      - routines sort_string_array() in sorting.f90
      - rrev(), rrev2() in angles.f90
      - warn(), error(), quit_program_warning(), quit_program_error() to system.f90
    * Added constants:
      - plana: semi-major axes of planets
      - currentmillisecond: useful for random-number seeds
     
  0.1.6  06/04/2011  (SVN rev.40)
    * Bugfix: removed a factor of pi from the constants (r)r2as and (r)as2r
    * Bugfix: use of dow_ut() to create the string constant currentdate
    * Fixed some implicit type conversions
    * Added routine wass() to angle2string.f90
    
    
  0.1.5  25/03/2011  (SVN rev.37)
    * Added source files:
      - angle2string.f90:  convert angles to formatted strings
      - time2string.f90:   convert times to formatted strings
    * Updated CMake files
    
          
  0.1.4  22/03/2011  (SVN rev.33)
    * Bugfix: the function dow() was still used but wasn't defined
              libraries could be compiled but not linked...
    
    
  0.1.3  12/03/2011  (SVN rev.31)
    * Added source files:
      - angles.f90: manipulate angles
      - system.f90: system calls
      - text.f90: procedures to manipulate strings
    * Updates:
      - date_and_time.f90: new procedures for date and time
    * Fixed minor issues
    * Updated Doxygen comments
    
    
  0.1.2  01/01/2011  (SVN rev.27)
    * Updated CMake files:
      - added section for g95
      - better recognition of compiler name
    * Code is now compatible with:
      - gfortran using the F2008 standard
      - g95 using the F2003 standard
      - ifort using the F2003 standard
    * Added single-precision equivalents of mathematical constants
    
        
  0.1.1  18/12/2010  (SVN rev.15)
    First released version, originally called libSUFR_001.tar.bz2, 
    then renamed to libSUFR-0.1.1.tar.bz2.
    This is an alpha release, many things need to be done still.
    Library contains routines for variable kinds, constants, binning, sorting, 
    interpolation, statistics, random numbers, date and time, and solvers.
